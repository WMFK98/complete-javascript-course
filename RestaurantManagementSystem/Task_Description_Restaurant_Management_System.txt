Task Description: Restaurant Management System

You are tasked with creating a Restaurant Management System in JavaScript. This system should allow you to manage a menu, take customer orders, and calculate the total bill. The code should be organized into different modules for better code structure.

Requirements:

Menu Module (menu.js): Create a module for the restaurant's menu. The module should include the following:

Define a class MenuItem with attributes: name, price, and description.
Create an array of MenuItem instances to represent the menu items.
Implement a method to add a new menu item to the array.
Implement a method to get the list of all menu items.
Order Module (order.js): Create a module to handle customer orders. The module should have the following functions:

Create an array to store customer orders. Each order should contain the selected menu item, quantity, and a reference to the customer.
Implement a function to take a new order by specifying the customer, menu item, and quantity.
Implement a function to retrieve all orders.
Implement a function to calculate the total bill for a specific customer's orders.
Customer Module (customer.js): Create a module for customer information. The module should include:

Define a class Customer with attributes: name, tableNumber, and a unique customerId.
Implement a method to create a new customer and assign them a unique customerId.
Main Application (main.js): Import and use the modules to:

Create a menu with at least five menu items.
Create at least three customers with unique IDs.
Allow customers to place orders (select menu items and quantities).
Display the list of all orders.
Calculate and display the total bill for each customer.
The code should be organized into separate modules for menu management, order handling, and customer information. The main application should import and use these modules to manage the restaurant's operations.

This exercise combines the use of classes, arrays, closures, and modules to create a functional restaurant management system. You should provide the code to implement the requirements outlined above.
